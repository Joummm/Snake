This project is a modern take on the classic Snake game, designed to deliver a retro gaming experience with enhanced visuals and responsive functionality. Built using HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, the game is simple yet engaging.

Key Features:
  1. Responsive Gameplay:
    Fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices. The controls adapt to keyboard inputs for desktop users and swipe gestures (or touch-based interactions) for mobile players.

  2. Dynamic Design:
    A sleek, dark mode theme with vibrant colors like green for the snake and red for the food, creating high contrast for better visibility and an immersive aesthetic.

  3. Game Mechanics:
    Classic Snake gameplay where the player controls a growing snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with the wall or itself.
    The game increases in difficulty as the snake grows longer.

  4.  Scoring System:
    A real-time score display updates as the snake collects food.
    A high score tracker is implemented using local storage, allowing players to strive for new personal bests.

  5. Interactive Features:
    A "Reset" button to restart the game instantly.
    Smooth animations with consistent frame rates for an enjoyable gaming experience.

  6. Custom "Game Over" Screen:
    Displays the player's final score in a clean and centered design when the game ends.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: Canvas element for rendering the game board and managing visuals.
CSS3: Styled with a retro font and a dark mode theme, ensuring modern aesthetics and usability.
JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including movement, collision detection, scoring, and high score tracking.

Purpose:
This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as event handling, state management, and animations. 
It's perfect for those learning web development or looking to build a nostalgic yet responsive web-based game.

Enjoy the challenge of controlling your snake, and aim for a new high score!
